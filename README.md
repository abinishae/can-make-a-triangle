# can-make-a-triangle
Given an array All of N elements, You'd like to know how many triangles can be formed with side lengths equal to adjacent elements from A[]. Construct an array of integers of length N-2 where ith element is equal to 1 if it is possible to form a triangle with side lengths A[i], A[i+1], and A[i+2] otherwise 0  Note: A triangle can be formed with side lengths a, b and c if a+b>c and a+c>b and b+c>a.
